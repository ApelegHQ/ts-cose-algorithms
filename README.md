### üöÄ Features

- Implements all assigined entries in [IANA's COSE Algorithm](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#algorithms) that have a name and a value.
- Simple exported constants, with no code to execute.
- Some name transformations were required to make them valid JS identifiers.
  - For example, `HMAC 256/64` becomes `HMAC256_s_64` and `ECDH-SS + HKDF-256`
    becomes `ECDH_SS_and_HKDF_256`.
- Incudes `JSDoc` with a description as well as a note as to whether the value
  is currently deprecated or recommended.
- It does _not_ support reverse lookups. For example, there is not built in way
  to find the name for, for example, the value `0` (a reverse lookup would yield
  `Reserved`).

### üíª Installation

To install the package, you can use npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install @exact-realty/cose-algorithms
```

or

```sh
yarn add @exact-realty/cose-algorithms
```

### üìö Usage

#### Decrypting Data

```javascript
import { encodings, decrypt } from '@exact-realty/cose-algorithms';

```
